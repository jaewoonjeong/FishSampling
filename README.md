# FishSampling

A web-based application guiding farmed salmon sampling to estimate sea louse abundance

ABSTRACT
Objective: Efficiently managing sea lice on salmon farms through active surveillance, crucial for lice abundance estimation, is challenging due to the need for effective sampling schemes. To address this, we developed an application that considers infestation levels, farm structure, and management protocols, enhancing the accuracy of sampling strategies for sea louse abundance estimation.
Methods: Simulation-based methods are valuable for estimating suitable sample sizes in complex studies where standard formulae are inadequate. We introduce 'FishSampling,' an open web-based application tailored to determine precise sample sizes for specific scenarios and objectives.
Result: The model incorporates factors like sea lice abundance, farm pen numbers, potential clustering effects among these pens, and the desired confidence level. Simulation outcomes emphasize the critical role of clustering considerations in sampling strategies.
Conclusion: This approach can be used across the salmon aquaculture sector to optimize sampling strategies and balance surveillance costs against health outcomes. 

Impact statement
This open-source application enhances sea lice monitoring on salmon farms with a novel simulation-based approach for sample size determination. It offers accurate estimates of sea lice abundance, crucial for regulatory purposes, and aids in the efficient allocation of sampling resources.

The necessary packages are shiny, shinyalert, kableExtra, shinyscreenshot, reshape, ggplot2, ggridges, ICC, and tibble.
