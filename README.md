An open web-based application to guide the determination of sampling size of farmed salmon for accurate estimation of sea louse abundance

ABSTRACT:
Sea lice infestation is a major threat to both salmon aquaculture, where the economic impact is devastating, and to wild salmonid conservation where increased parasitic burden may affect population viability. 
To manage these threats, active surveillance is routinely conducted on salmon farms to estimate the abundance of sea lice. 
However, the design of efficient sampling schemes for surveillance is challenging as sampling strategies must be consider infestation levels, farm structure, management protocols, as well as the practical logistics of obtaining samples in remote and/or extreme locations. 
Here, we present an open web-based application, ‘FishSampling’, that is designed to illustrate interactions between sample size and sampling accuracy in the context of sea lice surveillance within salmon aquaculture. 
The model that underpins this application considers sea lice abundance, the number of pens in a farm and likely clustering effects among these pens, as well as the desired level of confidence. 
We illustrate the functionality and capacity of ‘FishSampling’ for a set of hypothetical salmon farms operating under a variety of sampling regimes. 
The simulations emphasize the importance of decisions regarding the number of sampled fish per pen as well as the overall number of pens sampling within a farm. 
This approach, and the tool presented here, can be used across the salmon aquaculture sector to optimize sampling strategies and balance surveillance costs against health outcomes.
